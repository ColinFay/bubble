# bubble

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `{bubble}` is to launch and interact with a NodeJS session, from R. 

## Installation

You can install the dev version of `{bubble}` with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("colinfay/bubble")
```

## Example

> Note that you'll need to have NodeJS installed on your machine


### Using bubble to launch and communicate with a NodeJS session

Launch a new NodeJS session with `NodeSession$new()`. 

This function uses the path to your NodeJS binary. On MacOS, it can be found with `Sys.which("node")`, on Debian `Sys.which("nodejs")` (if installed through `apt-get install nodejs`).

`NodeSession$new()` tries to guess where NodeJS is by looking at both these `Sys`. If they are both empty, you'll get an error, and need to provide the path manually. The function to find Node is exported and called `find_node()`. It will either return the path to your local installation of Node or an error

```{r}
library(bubble)
find_node()
```

The `NodeSession$new()` function returns an object that can be used to interact with the launched Node session.

```{r example}
n <- NodeSession$new() 
n$eval("var x = 12")
n$eval("var y = 17")
n$eval("x + ")
n$eval("y")
# Return the x and y values
x <- n$get(x, y)
class(x)
sum(x)
n$state()
n$kill()
n$state()
```

### Using {bubble} to launch an express app

```{r error = TRUE}
n <- NodeSession$new()

n$eval("const express = require('express');")
n$eval("app = express()", print = FALSE)

n$eval("app.get('/', function (req, res) {", print = FALSE)
n$eval("  res.send('Hello R!')")
n$eval("})", print = FALSE)
n$eval("app.listen(3002)", print = FALSE)

x <- httr::GET("http://127.0.0.1:3002") 
httr::content(x)
n$kill()
httr::GET("http://127.0.0.1:3002") 
```


```{r include = FALSE}
Sys.sleep(5)
```


### Using {bubble} to launch a NodeJS terminal

```{r eval = FALSE}
node_repl()
```

> This REPL has been inspired by the one from `{reticulate}` : https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/

### Using {bubble} to launch a NodeJS script

```{r}
n <- NodeSession$new( 
  bin = "/usr/local/bin/node",
  params = "inst/launch.js"
)
x <- httr::GET("http://127.0.0.1:3000") 
httr::content(x)
n$terminate()
```

### Knitr

`{bubble}` comes with a knitr engine that can be set with `bubble::set_node_engine()` at the top of your markdown. 

Then, each chunck `{node}` will be evaluated in a Node session. 

You'll find an example in [inst/rmdexample.Rmd](inst/rmdexample.Rmd)
